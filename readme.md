# Electronic Voting Machine (EVM) Arduino Code

This Arduino sketch is for an Electronic Voting Machine (EVM) with the following components:

- Buttons for voting (Analog pins)
- Buzzer for audio feedback (Digital pin)
- SD card module for storing votes (Digital pin)
- I2C LCD display for showing instructions and results

## Setup

1. **Component Connections**:
   - Connect the buttons to a single analog pin (e.g., A0).
   - Connect the buzzer to a digital pin (e.g., 4).
   - Connect the SD card module to the appropriate digital pin (e.g., 10).
   - Connect the I2C LCD display as per its datasheet (e.g., 0x27).

2. **Libraries**:
   - Make sure you have the necessary libraries installed for the LCD display and SD card module.

3. **Arduino IDE**:
   - Load the `EVM.ino` Arduino sketch onto your Arduino board.

4. **SD Card**:
   - Insert a formatted SD card into the SD card module for data storage.

## Usage

1. Power on the EVM.

2. Follow the on-screen instructions displayed on the LCD display.

3. Use the analog button setup to cast your vote.

4. The buzzer will provide audio feedback for successful votes or errors.

5. All votes will be recorded on the SD card in the `votes.txt` file.

6. After voting, the LCD will display the candidate you voted for.

7. The result will be displayed for 5 seconds before returning to the main screen.

## Customization

You can customize the code to suit your specific needs and add more candidates or logic as required. Here are some areas you can customize:

- **Button Thresholds**:
  - Adjust the `buttonThresholds` array in the code to match your button press thresholds.

- **Additional Candidates**:
  - You can add more candidates and modify the LCD display messages accordingly.

- **Security Features**:
  - Consider implementing additional security features to ensure the integrity of the voting process.

- **Data Handling**:
  - You can modify how vote data is stored on the SD card or consider encryption if needed.

Please refer to the code comments for more detailed guidance on customization and further enhancements.

## Important Notes

- This code is a simplified example and may not cover all aspects of a real-world EVM. It's intended for educational purposes.

- Always follow legal and ethical guidelines when using electronic voting systems.

- Verify and validate your code thoroughly before deploying it in any election or critical environment.

- Ensure that you have proper data handling and privacy measures in place.
